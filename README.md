# The New Compliance Mandate: A Consolidated Analysis of DoD 8140 and CMMC for the Defense Industrial Base
## Basic research into CMMC and DoD 8140
The Department of Defense (DoD) has initiated the most significant transformation of its cybersecurity and workforce management policies in two decades. The full implementation of the DoD 8140 series, which formally replaced DoD Directive 8570 on February 15, 2023, coupled with the phased rollout of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program, creates a new and complex compliance landscape for the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). This report provides a consolidated, strategic analysis of these two frameworks, reconciles their implementation status, and delivers an actionable roadmap for defense contractors.
